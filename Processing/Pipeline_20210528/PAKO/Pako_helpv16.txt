; v15 Start Run6. Preparation in May 2013
; v16 edited with H Ungerecht's input (see the end for a verbatim)

--------- XEphem usage -------------------------------------------------
!! preliminary: if you want to use xephem with the position of the telescope displayed in real time
! run the following sequence from the command prompt 
slogin mrt-lx3
ps xa |grep azElToXephem.py & ! check if the script is already running, if not do the following
useNCS
azElToXephem.py &
! once the script is running type:
/vis/xephem/xephem

------- Managing Imbfits file -----------------------------------------------
; Telescope fits are in mrt-lx1
/ncsServer/mrt/ncs/data/imbfits/bol
on mrt-lx1 (not gra-lx1)

or best
/ncsServer/mrt/ncs/data/20120604/scans

/ncsServer/mrt/ncs/data/20120604/datastreams/bbc

processed imbfits files are
/ncs/data/imbfits/bol/
; Or in ?
/ncsServer/mrt/ncs/data/datastreams/nika/2012
; Or in ?
/ncsServer/mrt/ncs/data/imbfits/bol

; There is a script to copy imbfits files from Iram to sami locally e.g.
; not necessary anymore ./Backup_telescope.bash 20121024

; To process NIKA raw data files onto fits files and imbfits files
; log in sami on a dedicated window

; Old convert_fits_files2

!!!  Attention, ini is the new init file for NIKA, do not use the old nini which will create problems !!!


!!! Check that the NCS knows the current project is t21
!!! otherwise the telescope will not obey you pako commands !
!!! --> look at the OperatorControl screen and/or ask the operator

! Once you have entered an observing mode (See below)
! if you want that the telescope executes your commands do no forget
SET DOSUBMIT YES

! start an observation (MAKE SURE you want that)

! procedures for tunning:
@ diy-test-00.pako ! 11 seconds track with 440 330 RA DEC offset to tune NIKA resonances
!   Note the text parameter "Tune" is sent through NCS (then Elvin) to be used by data acquisition
! 
@ diy-test-03.pako ! big 600x600 arcsec OTF map with 66 steps of 20" each, and 10 seconds pause
!  at each end of subscan for frequency tunning, the text parameter sent by NCS is "big OTF with tunes"
!
@ diy-test-12.pako ! sky dip from 1.1 to 3.5 airmass by step of 0.4, with 11 sec for tunning
!  followed by 22 sec for measure at each step, the text parameter sent by NCS is "tuned Tip"



! procedure to focus
! to set focus correction in mm wrt the current focus
SET FOCUS -2.4

! Change the Nasmyth offset to chose a pixel a being the reference for the pointing

! position switching (not necessary anymore in normal operation of NIKA)
ONOFF   !
! example (give ON offsets and OFF offsets, 2 positions each, 2 systems)

! other options (30 seconds per subscan):
/nsubscans 12 /symmetric /tsubscan 30
!
! projection is RADEC system here
! can use /SYSTEM trueHorizon too
!
! if wobbler on use the following special mode
! in that case the off position is automatically on the off wobbler position
ONOFF /swwobbler /nsubscans 12 /symmetric /tsubscan 30

!------------  Display the scanning pattern with GREG
In the preamble of pako scripts, we should define in a few lines
the parameters of the display window of PaKo. This is particulary useful to visualize
the scanning pattern of the telescope and may prevent wrong scanning strategies.
This can also be usued interactively in the PaKo command line.
The example below is taken from the script pointing_lissajous.pako
!-----  Setup the display parameters to check the map geometry ---------
LIMITS 70 -70 -85 60	                ! Set the plot boundaries (Xleft Xright Ydown Yup)
clear  plot                             ! clear previous plot(s)
box                                     ! draw the bounding box
label "x" /X                            ! Write the "string" label on the x axis
label "y" /Y                            ! same on the y axis
ellipse 9.3 /user  20 -60 /fill 2	! Draw an ellipse at a specified location 
                                        ! ellipse 'diameter' /coordinateSystem Xpos Ypos /fillTheEllipse colorCode
draw text  20 -75 "Beam@2mm" /user      ! Add text annotations in /user coordinates

Then the scanning pattern is plotted in this window when the otf, or lissajous, or pointing, etc. 
command is executed in PaKo (but before the scan "start" so that we can check the scan pattern beforehand).

One can zoon interactively on this display window by typing "zoom" at the PaKo prompt.
Then mouse over the window, increase (decrease) the zoom factor with the 
keyboard stroke "z" (-). Pressing the "space" bar will create the zoon window. You exit with "e".

; Hans Ungerecht's email about 8Hz and Lissajous
Notes on Lissajous with NIKA
=============================


As requested by CK and NB, in project account T21 on mrt-lx1 I have defined
that:

t21@mrt-lx1:~/PaKo$ pakoNIKA
PAKO> show
I-SHOW        ,  paKo Revision v 1.1.14.1 2013-06-01

calls a new version of paKo that allows to use observing mode Lissajous with
NIKA.  (As usual, you enter goPako and pakoDisplay before pakoNIKA).


To get the same version of pako in any other account, use:

/local/users/pako/Development/gildas-src/packages/pako/main/pakoNIKA.exe

Using this version of pako with NIKA will switch the slowRate in antenna mount
drive to 8Hz, which is necessary for Lissajous.

If you have any questions about the use of the pako commands, please contact
me (HU).

Good luck,
Hans


IMPORTANT: After using this version of pako and/or slowRate 8 in the antenna
mount drive control system, and before other observations outside the NIKA
pool or before observing with the previous version of pakoNIKA[old]: THE
ANTENNA MOUNT DRIVE COMPUTER vac1 MUST BE REBOOTED BY THE OPERATOR.



Known issues
============

With antenna mount drive slowRate 8 all TRACK subscans are executed about 2
sec shorter than commanded. This can be compensated by specifying a time per
subscan 2 sec longer.  This applies, e.g., to: observing modes TRACK, ONOFF,
and TIP, as well as track and tune SUBSCANS.

Occasionally, the trackFlags can be < 0, indicating a problem in the execution
of the slow loop. To be conservative, the corresponding data should be flagged
out.

The tracking errors and flags can be supervised with AS's tracking monitor:
https://mrt-lx1.iram.es/mrt/ncs/monitor/30mTracking/30mTrackingLast-1.pdf

Not all observing modes are fully tested and debugged with slowRate 8.



Important characteristic of fast Lissajous:
===========================================

For Lissajous near the maximum speeds and accelerations (high amplitude and/or
frequency), the tracking errors will be larger than we normally accept at the
30m, i.e., several arc sec.  This will in particular be the case at the times
of maximum acceleration.

AS is the contact for how this information is delivered to the other
subsystems and can be taken into account by the data processing, as well as
for the tracking monitor mentioned above.




Fallback / previous version of pako for NIKA
============================================

To get the version of pako used in the previous NIKA run (2012-11), use:

t21@mrt-lx1:~/PaKo$ pakoNIKA2012

PAKO> show
I-SHOW        ,  paKo Revision v 1.1.14 2012-11-14

To get the same version of pako in any other account:
