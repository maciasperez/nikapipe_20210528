This files were computed using the ATM model with the following
assumptions:
observatory pico
atm 2009
atm%profile%humidity 25.0
ATM%PROFILE%TYPE "midlatwinter"
forward_eff 0.90     ! Just to put a realistic value.
airmass 1.0          ! Roughly 90 deg. elevation
gain_image 0.0       ! Gain...intended for heterodyne receivers
trec 0.0             ! Receiver Temperature (K)
The data are ordered in 4 columns consisting of:
