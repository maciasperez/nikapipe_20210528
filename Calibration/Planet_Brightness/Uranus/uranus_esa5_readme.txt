Disclaimer note about the "ESA5" Uranus model by G. Orton
---------------------------------------------------------

Users might be confronted to a so-called ESA5 Uranus model, which was 
produced by Glenn Orton (JPL) as an evolution of the ESA4 model that 
was used for the calibration of the SPIRE spectrometer data.

This model showed very limited differences in the SPIRE regime, but some
discrepancy in the PACS regime, as has been described in a detailed study
by Mueller et al. 2016 (A&A 588, A109 - please note that hyperlinks to the
model in this paper are obsolete). As a consequence, the Herschel Calibration 
Steering Group decided to not endorse the model and it was therefore not 
officially released.

In case you wish to use this model for your work, we recommend that you get in
contact directly with Glenn Orton (Glenn.S.Orton@jpl.nasa.gov), and that you 
bear in mind the caveats it may still have in certain wavelength ranges.
