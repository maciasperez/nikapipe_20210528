To compute the fluxes of planets
1. install Herve Aussel's "photometry package": https://github.com/haussel/photometry
(no need for stellar and galaxy libraries)
2. check that you have beautifulsoup, requests and html5lib installed in your local python setup and $PYTHONPATH
3. update runinfo.txt with the relevant dates (respect tabulations between columns)
4. in a terminal, type: python3 nika2_run_preparation.py
